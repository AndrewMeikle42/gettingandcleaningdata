Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This project contains the files:
  - run_analysis.R
  - README.md
  - CodeBook.md
 
The purpose of this project is to prepare tidy data for later analysis, in particular data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

The original data is available here - http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

For recreation purposes, the data used is archived here - https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

To tidy the data using R, you first need to download the data into your current working directory, saved using the folowing filename: "getdata_projectfiles_UCI HAR Dataset.zip"

You can then run the "run_analysis.R" script which should produce a "tidydata.txt" file. The data is described in the "CodeBook.md" file
